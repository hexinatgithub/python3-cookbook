## Classes as objects

In most languages, classes are just pieces of code that describe how to produce an object. That's kinda true in Python too:

```python
>>> class ObjectCreator(object):
...       pass
...

>>> my_object = ObjectCreator()
>>> print(my_object)
<__main__.ObjectCreator object at 0x8974f2c>
```

But classes are more than that in Python. Classes are objects too.

Yes, objects.

As soon as you use the keyword class, Python executes it and creates an OBJECT. The instruction

```python
>>> class ObjectCreator(object):
...       pass
...
```

**This object (the class) is itself capable of creating objects (the instances), and this is why it's a class.**

## Creating classes dynamically

Since classes are objects, you can create them on the fly, like any object.

First, you can create a class in a function using class:

```python
>>> def choose_class(name):
...     if name == 'foo':
...         class Foo(object):
...             pass
...         return Foo # return the class, not an instance
...     else:
...         class Bar(object):
...             pass
...         return Bar
...
>>> MyClass = choose_class('foo')
>>> print(MyClass) # the function returns a class, not an instance
<class '__main__.Foo'>
>>> print(MyClass()) # you can create an object from this class
<__main__.Foo object at 0x89c6d4c>
```

But it's not so dynamic, since you still have to write the whole class yourself.

Since classes are objects, they must be generated by something.

When you use the class keyword, Python creates this object automatically. But as with most things in Python, it gives you a way to do it manually.

Remember the function `type`? The good old function that lets you know what type an object is:

```python
>>> print(type(1))
<type 'int'>
>>> print(type("1"))
<type 'str'>
>>> print(type(ObjectCreator))
<type 'type'>
>>> print(type(ObjectCreator()))
<class '__main__.ObjectCreator'>
```
Well, type has a completely different ability, it can also create classes on the fly. type can take the description of a class as parameters, and return a class.

(I know, it's silly that the same function can have two completely different uses according to the parameters you pass to it. It's an issue due to backwards compatibility in Python)

`type` works this way:

```python
type(name of the class,
     tuple of the parent class (for inheritance, can be empty),
     dictionary containing attributes names and values)
```

e.g.:

```python
>>> class MyShinyClass(object):
...       pass
```

can be created manually this way:

```python
>>> MyShinyClass = type('MyShinyClass', (), {}) # returns a class object
>>> print(MyShinyClass)
<class '__main__.MyShinyClass'>
>>> print(MyShinyClass()) # create an instance with the class
<__main__.MyShinyClass object at 0x8997cec>
```

type accepts a dictionary to define the attributes of the class. So:

```python
>>> class Foo(object):
...       bar = True
```

Can be translated to:

```python
>>> Foo = type('Foo', (), {'bar':True})
```

And used as a normal class:

```python
>>> print(Foo)
<class '__main__.Foo'>
>>> print(Foo.bar)
True
>>> f = Foo()
>>> print(f)
<__main__.Foo object at 0x8a9b84c>
>>> print(f.bar)
True
```

And of course, you can inherit from it, so:

```python
>>>   class FooChild(Foo):
...         pass
```

would be:

```python
>>> FooChild = type('FooChild', (Foo,), {})
>>> print(FooChild)
<class '__main__.FooChild'>
>>> print(FooChild.bar) # bar is inherited from Foo
True
```

Eventually you'll want to add methods to your class. Just define a function with the proper signature and assign it as an attribute.

```python
>>> def echo_bar(self):
...       print(self.bar)
...
>>> FooChild = type('FooChild', (Foo,), {'echo_bar': echo_bar})
>>> hasattr(Foo, 'echo_bar')
False
>>> hasattr(FooChild, 'echo_bar')
True
>>> my_foo = FooChild()
>>> my_foo.echo_bar()
True
```

And you can add even more methods after you dynamically create the class, just like adding methods to a normally created class object.

```python
>>> def echo_bar_more(self):
...       print('yet another method')
...
>>> FooChild.echo_bar_more = echo_bar_more
>>> hasattr(FooChild, 'echo_bar_more')
True
```

You see where we are going: in Python, classes are objects, and you can create a class on the fly, dynamically.

This is what Python does when you use the keyword `class`, and it does so by using a metaclass.

## What are metaclasses (finally)

Metaclasses are the 'stuff' that creates classes.

You define classes in order to create objects, right?

But we learned that Python classes are objects.

Well, metaclasses are what create these objects. They are the classes' classes, you can picture them this way:

```python
MyClass = MetaClass()
my_object = MyClass()
```

You've seen that `type` lets you do something like this:

```python
MyClass = type('MyClass', (), {})
```

It's because the function type is in fact a metaclass. type is the metaclass Python uses to create all classes behind the scenes.

Now you wonder why the heck is it written in lowercase, and not Type?

Well, I guess it's a matter of consistency with str, the class that creates strings objects, and int the class that creates integer objects. type is just the class that creates class objects.

You see that by checking the `__class__` attribute.

Everything, and I mean everything, is an object in Python. That includes ints, strings, functions and classes. All of them are objects. And all of them have been created from a class:

```python
>>> age = 35
>>> age.__class__
<type 'int'>
>>> name = 'bob'
>>> name.__class__
<type 'str'>
>>> def foo(): pass
>>> foo.__class__
<type 'function'>
>>> class Bar(object): pass
>>> b = Bar()
>>> b.__class__
<class '__main__.Bar'>
```

Now, what is the `__class__` of any `__class__` ?

```python
>>> age.__class__.__class__
<type 'type'>
>>> name.__class__.__class__
<type 'type'>
>>> foo.__class__.__class__
<type 'type'>
>>> b.__class__.__class__
<type 'type'>
```

So, a metaclass is just the stuff that creates class objects.

You can call it a 'class factory' if you wish.

`type` is the built-in metaclass Python uses, but of course, you can create your own metaclass.

### The `__metaclass__` attribute

You can add a `__metaclass__` attribute when you write a class:

```python
class Foo(object):
    __metaclass__ = something...
    [...]
```

If you do so, Python will use the metaclass to create the class Foo.

Careful, it's tricky.

You write `class Foo(object)` first, but the class object `Foo` is not created in memory yet.

Python will look for `__metaclass__` in the class definition. If it finds it, it will use it to create the object class `Foo`. If it doesn't, it will use `type` to create the class.

Read that several times.

When you do:

```python
class Foo(Bar):
    pass
```

Python does the following:

Is there a `__metaclass__` attribute in Foo?

If yes, create in memory a class object (I said a class object, stay with me here), with the name Foo by using what is in `__metaclass__`.

If Python can't find `__metaclass__`, it will look for a `__metaclass__` at the MODULE level, and try to do the same (but only for classes that don't inherit anything, basically old-style classes).

Then if it can't find any `__metaclass__` at all, it will use the `Bar`'s (the first parent) own metaclass (which might be the default type) to create the class object.

Be careful here that the `__metaclass__` attribute will not be inherited, the metaclass of the parent (`Bar.__class__`) will be. If `Bar` used a `__metaclass__` attribute that created `Bar` with `type()` (and not `type.__new__()`), the subclasses will not inherit that behavior.

Now the big question is, what can you put in `__metaclass__` ?

The answer is: something that can create a class.

And what can create a class? `type`, or anything that subclasses or uses it.

## Custom metaclasses

The main purpose of a metaclass is to change the class automatically, when it's created.

You usually do this for APIs, where you want to create classes matching the current context.

Imagine a stupid example, where you decide that all classes in your module should have their attributes written in uppercase. There are several ways to do this, but one way is to set `__metaclass__` at the module level.

This way, all classes of this module will be created using this metaclass, and we just have to tell the metaclass to turn all attributes to uppercase.

Luckily, `__metaclass__` can actually be any *callable*, it doesn't need to be a formal class (I know, something with 'class' in its name doesn't need to be a class, go figure... but it's helpful).

So we will start with a simple example, by using a function.

```python
# the metaclass will automatically get passed the same argument
# that you usually pass to `type`
def upper_attr(future_class_name, future_class_parents, future_class_attr):
    """
      Return a class object, with the list of its attribute turned
      into uppercase.
    """

    # pick up any attribute that doesn't start with '__' and uppercase it
    uppercase_attr = {}
    for name, val in future_class_attr.items():
        if not name.startswith('__'):
            uppercase_attr[name.upper()] = val
        else:
            uppercase_attr[name] = val

    # let `type` do the class creation
    return type(future_class_name, future_class_parents, uppercase_attr)

__metaclass__ = upper_attr # this will affect all classes in the module

class Foo(): # global __metaclass__ won't work with "object" though
    # but we can define __metaclass__ here instead to affect only this class
    # and this will work with "object" children
    bar = 'bip'

print(hasattr(Foo, 'bar'))
# Out: False
print(hasattr(Foo, 'BAR'))
# Out: True

f = Foo()
print(f.BAR)
# Out: 'bip'
```

Now, let's do exactly the same, but using a real class for a metaclass:

```python
class UpperAttrMetaclass(type):

    def __new__(cls, clsname, bases, dct):

        uppercase_attr = {}
        for name, val in dct.items():
            if not name.startswith('__'):
                uppercase_attr[name.upper()] = val
            else:
                uppercase_attr[name] = val

        return type.__new__(cls, clsname, bases, uppercase_attr)
```

You may have noticed the extra argument `cls`. There is nothing special about it: `__new__` always receives the class it's defined in, as first parameter. Just like you have self for ordinary methods which receive the instance as first parameter, or the defining class for class methods.

The reason behind the complexity of the code using metaclasses is not because of metaclasses, it's because you usually use metaclasses to do twisted stuff relying on introspection, manipulating inheritance, vars such as `__dict__`, etc.

Indeed, metaclasses are especially useful to do black magic, and therefore complicated stuff. But by themselves, they are simple:

* intercept a class creation
* modify the class
* return the modified class

### Why would you use metaclasses classes instead of functions?

Since `__metaclass__` can accept any callable, why would you use a class since it's obviously more complicated?

There are several reasons to do so:

* The intention is clear. When you read UpperAttrMetaclass(type), you know what's going to follow
* You can use OOP. Metaclass can inherit from metaclass, override parent methods. Metaclasses can even use metaclasses.
* Subclasses of a class will be instances of its metaclass if you specified a metaclass-class, but not with a metaclass-function.
* You can structure your code better. You never use metaclasses for something as trivial as the above example. It's usually for something complicated. Having the ability to make several methods and group them in one class is very useful to make the code easier to read.
* You can hook on `__new__`, `__init__` and `__call__`. Which will allow you to do different stuff. Even if usually you can do it all in `__new__`, some people are just more comfortable using `__init__`.
* These are called metaclasses, damn it! It must mean something!

### Why would you use metaclasses?

Now the big question. Why would you use some obscure error prone feature?

Well, usually you don't:

Metaclasses are deeper magic that 99% of users should never worry about. If you wonder whether you need them, you don't (the people who actually need them know with certainty that they need them, and don't need an explanation about why).
