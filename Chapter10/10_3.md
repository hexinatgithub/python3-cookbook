# 10.3. Importing Package Submodules Using Relative Names

To import modules of a package from other modules in the same package, use a packagerelative import. For example, suppose you have a package mypackage organized as fol‚Äê
lows on the filesystem:

```txt
mypackage/
    __init__.py
    A/
        __init__.py
        spam.py
        grok.py
    B/
        __init__.py
        bar.py
```

If the module mypackage.A.spam wants to import the module grok located in the same
directory, it should include an import statement like this:

```python
# mypackage/A/spam.py
from . import grok
```

If the same module wants to import the module B.bar located in a different directory,
it can use an import statement like this:

```python
# mypackage/A/spam.py
from ..B import bar
```

Both of the import statements shown operate relative to the location of the `spam.py` file
and do not include the top-level package name.

The `.` and `..` syntax on the import statement might look funny, but think of it as specifying a directory name. `.` means look in the current directory and `..B` means look in the `../B` directory. This syntax only works with the `from` form of import. For example:

```python
from . import grok # OK
import .grok # ERROR
```
