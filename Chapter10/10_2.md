# 10.2. Controlling the Import of Everything

You want precise control over the symbols that are exported from a module or package
when a user uses the `from module import *` statement.

```python
# somemodule.py
def spam():
    pass

def grok():
    pass

blah = 42
# Only export 'spam' and 'grok'
__all__ = ['spam', 'grok']
```

Although the use of from module import * is strongly discouraged, it still sees frequent
use in modules that define a large number of names. If you don’t do anything, this form
of import will export all names that don’t start with an underscore. On the other hand,
if __all__ is defined, then only the names explicitly listed will be exported.
If you define __all__ as an empty list, then nothing will be exported. An AttributeEr
ror is raised on import if __all__ contains undefined names.
